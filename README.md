This repository contains the code used in the article titled *"Enhancing Cognitive Workload Classification Using Integrated LSTM Layers and CNNs for fNIRS Data Analysis"*.

The research explores advanced methods for analyzing functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) data using the fNIRS Tufts dataset to enhance the classification of cognitive workload. By integrating Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers, the study demonstrates improved accuracy in recognizing varying levels of cognitive load.
